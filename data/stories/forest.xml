There were times when <b>|</b>, the village healer, cursed himself/herself| for deciding to become a healer, and this was one of them. Little <b>|Child</b> has brain fever, and the only way he/she|Child would survive the night is if he/she| could make a potion with <b>a |Plant</b> plant. Unfortunately, she is out of this herb, and the only way to get more of it is to search the Wicked Forest. He/she| considers telling the family that they would have to be the ones to do this, but his/her| conscience tells him/her| that it is his/her| duty, besides which they might not recognize it and pick the wrong plant. Also the gold helps.
